    Overview
    !!! XML
    %a
      {href: url("/profile")} Overview
    of your profile. It pulls your full name and other details (see above) from your ORCID account, which you may refresh at any time. Click the

    %a
      {href: url("/profile/candidates")} Discovered
    tab to see a list of candidate specimens. Much like an email inbox, Bionomia shows the number of specimens that await action.
    Specimen data are fully refreshed from the

    Help Others
    
    to search for your peers, mentors, or anyone who inspires you. Attribute specimens to them just as you claimed your own specimens. If they too have an ORCID ID, they may send you a quick thanks and these will appear in your Thanks Received tab.
