  Account Terms
%p
  We have a few simple rules for User Accounts on Bionomia.

    You must be a human to create an Account via ORCID's passthrough authentication. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.
  %li
    One person may maintain no more than one free Account.

    You must be age 13 or older. Bionomia does not target its Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User&#x2019;s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country&#x2019;s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country&#x2019;s laws.

    Your login may only be used by one person &#x2014; i.e., a single login through ORCID may not be shared by multiple people.
